POST a PEM encoded ECDSA P-256 private key to get back a PEM encoded
certificate complete with it's certificate chain. This is a less-secure than
the /cert-from-csr endpoint because with this endpoint you are sending me
your private key, which I don't actually need.

While the private key is not stored on the server, it will be used to
generate a CSR which will be stored for use with the /cert/ endpoint.

NOTE: repeated requests to this endpoint with the same key will not result
in a new certificate being issued. Rather the same (still valid) cert will
be returned until it gets close to expiring.
