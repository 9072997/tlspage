POST a PEM or DER encoded CSR to this endpoint to validate it and to get
back the hostname in the CSR. This is a convenience function in the sense
that you could do this locally, but the validation logic is specific to this
application. This endpoint will check that the CSR's subject is the correct
based on the hash of the public key.

The server will remember your CSR for future use with the /cert/ endpoint,
but that's fine. CSRs aren't secret.
