POST a PEM encoded ECDSA P-256 private key to this endpoint and you will get
back the basename (in the format "xxx.xxx.tls.page") that would correspond
to it. This is not exactly secure in the sense that you are sending me your
private key, and I don't really need it.

While the private key is not stored on the server, it will be used to
generate a CSR which will be stored for use with the /cert/ endpoint.
