POST a PEM or DER encoded CSR containing a correctly calculated hostname to
this endpoint to get back PEM encoded certificate complete with it's
certificate chain. This is the main endpoint for the application, and with a
sufficiently advanced client, this is the only thing that *needs* to be done
on the server.

The server will remember your CSR for future use with the /cert/ endpoint,
but that's fine. CSRs aren't secret.

NOTE: repeated requests to this endpoint with the same public key will not
result in a new certificate being issued. Rather the same (still valid) cert
will be returned until it gets close to expiring.
